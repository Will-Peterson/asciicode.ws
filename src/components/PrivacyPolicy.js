                This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally
                Identifiable Information' (PPI) is being used online. PPI, as described in US privacy law and information 
                security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or 
                to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding 
                of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance 
                with our website.

                California Online Privacy Protection Act
            </strong></p>
            <p>
                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post 
                a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in 
                the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable 
                Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating 
                exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

                <strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users can visit our website anonymously.</li>

            <p>
                When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, 
                the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade 
                Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out 
                operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
            </p>
            <p>

                <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and 
               the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws 
               around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be 
               implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive 
                    action, should a data breach occur:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will notify the users via in-site notification
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Within 1 business day</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to 
                legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the 
                law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, 
                but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investiage and/or 
                prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
